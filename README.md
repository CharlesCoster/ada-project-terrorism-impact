# Impact of terrorism on european citizen

## Abstract -> Charles
For the past hundred years terrorism as been part of the life of the European Citizen. At different time period, some parts of the continent have been impacted by a lot of terrorist attacks due to conflictual situations (Western Europe in the last decades, Ireland and the UK between the 70's and the 90's, Spain in the beggining of the 2000's, ...). Those terrorists attack can have different goal (religious, politics, ideological,...) but they impact the life of the citizen of the country, city that they target. We want to study and understand what is the impact of terrorism on the European citizen through different prism: Politics, Economics, Religious and life habits (leisure time, consumption, ...).  We aere then looking for terrorist attacks data, political and religious data in Europe as well as economical and daily habits of European citizen accross the last decades. Not only do we want to tell the story of the European continents through the last couples of decades but we also want to understand its complicated link to terrorism that we think will work both ways.


## Research questions
With importance of terrorism nowadays, many questions arise on different aspect of the citizen life. 
- **Political context** : the political context in a country reflect in part the attitude of citizen towards foreigners. Do we assist to a rise of extremist political parties ? We will be interested in the evolution of governements in european countries and in the political belief of citizen.
- **Economic context** : the economic growth is linked to leisures, in particular according to art, textile and touristic industries. Do we observe a significant economic recession in these sectors? We will be interested in different economic indicator related to leisure of citizen.
- **Religious context** : in difficult times, people are prone to turn to religion because they need something to believe in. Moreover, many terrorism attack are religious. How does the religious affiliation evolve in terrorism period? We will be interest in sentiment of religious belief and religious habits.

## Dataset
In order to conduct our investigation, we will use datas from many sources. Here we draw-up a non exhaustive list of dataset we will use :
- [Comparative Political Data Set](http://www.cpds-data.org/index.php/data) contains annual political and institutional data for 36 european countries (1960-2017). All the documentation about this dataset is given in a [Codebook](http://www.cpds-data.org/images/Update2019/Codebook-Government-Composition-1960-2017.pdf). 
- [Europe Political Affiliation](https://europeelects.eu/data/) provides information on the european political affiliation from  to per country according to different survey. Data will be collected using web scrapping.
- [Global Terrorism Database](https://www.kaggle.com/START-UMD/gtd) provides informations about more than 180,000 terrorist attacks worldwide from 1970 to 2017. Datas are stored on a csv file.
- [Europe Religous Affiliation](https://www.smre-data.ch/en/data_exploring/region_cockpit#/mode/dataset_comparison/region/FRA/period/2010/presentation/table) shows the detailed religious affiliation per country from 2006 to 2015. We will collect all these datas using web scrapping. We are interested in the evolution of religious affiliation during terrorism's periods (does it increase or decrease, does it remain the same, ...).
- [European Economical Growth](https://tradingeconomics.com/api/?source=summary) provides an API available on [Github](https://github.com/tradingeconomics/tradingeconomics). We can get information about economical growth in Europe from 1996 to 2019. Several 

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2 
## 1. Handle the raw data & general data analysis (to be done before nov. 11th)
 - [ ] Check how we get data on our computer and how we can handle the variety of sources.
 - [ ] Get information on what has been done on the subject
 - [ ] Scrapping of the targeted websites to complete our datasets.
 - [ ] Explore individually the 4 sources (distributions, visual apparence, ...) and look for inconsistencies.
 - [ ] Create functions to rapidely retrieve the essential information of each dataset. 
 
## 2. See how we can link the data (to be done before nov. 21th)
 - [ ] Start putting together the dataset about terrorism and the others.
 - [ ] Dealing with the datasets that don't have the same period of data.
 - [ ] Start looking on the best way to show the relations between the datasets.
 
## 3. Finalize th notebook and future plans (until deadline nov. 25th)
 - [ ] Have a well commented notebook and nice visualization that we can use for the data story.
 - [ ] From our results start thinking on how we can present this datastory.
 - [ ] Set up the internal milestones for MS3.

## Questions for TA -> tout le monde
Is the project too ambitious ? Do we have too many sources ?
