# Impact of terrorism on european citizen

## Abstract 
For the past hundred years, Europe has suffered several terrorist attacks that had considerable consequences on european citizen lifes. At different time period, some parts of the continent have been impacted by a lot of terrorist attacks due to conflictual situations (Western Europe in the last decades, Ireland and the UK between the 70's and the 90's, Spain in the beggining of the 2000's, ...). Those terrorists attack have different goals (religious, politics, ideological,...) but they always impact the life of the citizen of the country/city that they target. We want to study and understand what is the impact of terrorism on european citizen through different topics: Politics, Economics, Religious and Social (leisure time, consumption, ...).  We are looking for terrorist attacks data, political and religious data in Europe as well as economical and daily habits of European citizen accross the last decades. We want to link the changes that happened in the European continent with the growth of terrorism in his territory. 


## Research questions
With importance of terrorism nowadays, many questions arise on different aspect of the citizen life. 
- **Political context** : the political context in a country reflect in part the attitude of citizen towards foreigners. Do we assist to a rise of extremist political parties ? We will be interested in the evolution of governements in european countries and in the political belief of citizen.
- **Economic context** : the economic growth is linked to leisures, in particular according to art, textile and touristic industries. Do we observe a significant economic recession in these sectors? We will be interested in different economic indicator related to leisure of citizen.
- **Religious context** : in difficult times, people are prone to turn to religion because they need something to believe in. Moreover, many terrorism attack are religious. How does the religious affiliation evolve in terrorism period? We will be interest in sentiment of religious belief and religious habits.

## Dataset
In order to conduct our investigation, we will use datas from many sources. Here we draw-up a non exhaustive list of dataset we will use :
- [Comparative Political Data Set](http://www.cpds-data.org/index.php/data) contains annual political and institutional data for 36 european countries (1960-2017). All the documentation about this dataset is given in a [Codebook](http://www.cpds-data.org/images/Update2019/Codebook-Government-Composition-1960-2017.pdf). 
- [Europe Political Affiliation](https://europeelects.eu/data/) provides information on the european political affiliation from  to per country according to different survey. Data will be collected using web scrapping.
- [Polling from across Europe](https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/austria/) provides results of polling from 2014 to 2019
